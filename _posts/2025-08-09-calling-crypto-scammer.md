## Calling A Crypto Scammer

## ATTENTION HACKER NEWS: HELP ME GET MORE INTEL LIKE THE URL OF THEIR PHISHING LINK. SEE NOTES BELOW. OR CALL JUST TO PISS THEM OFF.

So I get this typical coinbase fake email. I'm really bored so decide to call it.
A gentleman with a UK accent picks up the line and asks me for my name. I can hear what appears to be a call center audio track on loop. More on this later. 
He politley walks me through some half-baked verification by asking what my portfolio balence and the amounts of crypto I have. First mistake of the day, I tell him I have around 250K. He then asks when the last time I had access to my account. I tell him it was a few days ago.
He wants me to tell him the EXACT ammounts I have. I do a quick google calculation on the conversion and I say 1.29 BTC. Then he asks the amount of the ETH. I pause and do another calculation. He then randomly asks about a "token activation". I say yes I see it. He then hangsup on me. Turns out they were asking questions expecting a no to verify I was not trying to dupe them.

So I call again. Different guy answers with maybe an indian accent. I can hear an annoying iMessage notification sound in the background on repeat. We go through the same thing. But this time he asks about a "self destruct button". I say no. But I fudge up and agree to the token activation. He then calmly tells me to place my phone under my pillow "becasue your fucking dreaming bro." He then tells me fuck off.
So I call back yet again. The first guy answers and tells me that I don't have an account. I act concered that I was cussed at and explain I got things mixed up. He then asks for the prevoius ammounts. I fuck up and tell him the incorrect ETH amount.

## What I learned:
- Have the actual coinbase app open.
- Have the amounts all the way down to 8 digits written down
- Have a reasonbly small portfolio (like 15K USD)
